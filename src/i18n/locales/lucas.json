That meteor, as luck would have it, is actually the infamous Murderous Purple Slimy Meteor—fear of galaxies everywhere! Using Dr. Fred as its unwilling instrument, the meteor has taken to kidnapping teenagers to... well, extract their brains. Classy. The latest victim is Dave's girlfriend Sandy, a cheerleader who probably didn't sign up for this. Dave, being the hero type (or at least pretending to be), has gathered some friends and is heading into the mansion to rescue her. What could possibly go wrong?",
